                <p>I’m a Visual Communications Design (BFA) major at the University of Notre Dame, but I am originally from Chicago. </p> 

                <p>I started taking art classes at the Art Institute of Chicago when I was in 5th grade and took my first graphic design class there in 7th grade. I started looking into graphic design because while I liked studio art, I can’t say I loved it. However, I knew that I wanted to do something artistic going forward. I realized that I loved working with colors and patterns, as you can imagine when adult coloring books came out I was ecstatic. After looking on the internet to find a major where I could pursue my passion, I  found graphic design as a possible major in college. Going into college I knew that this was what I wanted to do. Since then I have taken Intro to Graphic Design, Typography, Web Design, Photography, and other studio classes. Although design can be very frustrating at times, I love being able to solve different problems and see how my design has evolved throughout the design process. </p> 

                <p> When I am not in class or doing work for my design classes, I am usually volunteering for Camp Kesem either trying to raise money for them or going to a week long sleepover camp in the summer for these kids whose parents are affected by cancer. You can also find me traveling as my parents gave me the travel bug when they took me and my two brothers to a variety of international destinations. I traveled to London last summer as part of a study abroad program and will go to Jerusalem this summer and I will spend the whole incoming fall semester in Rome.  </p>
