            <div class="about-me-info">
                <p>I’m a Visual Communications Design (BFA) major at the University of Notre Dame with a minor in Computing Digital Technologies (UI/UX concentration). I am originally from Chicago. </p> 

                <p>No one is surprised that I chose Visual Communication Design as my major, including me! Since I can remember, I have been drawn to art and creative design. After taking many classes at the Art Institute over almost a decade, including early college courses, I realized that I loved using an interplay between colors, pattern and text to solve problems and challenges that were presented to me. Since starting at Notre Dame, I have continued my education in art and design, taking courses in Graphic Design, Typography, Web Design, Photography, Design Thinking, and other studio classes. I have been able to utilize the skills gained from these classes and apply them in real-world situations, including serving as a graphic designer for Notre Dame’s newspaper, The Observer, designing apparel as the apparel commissioner for my dorm, and as a graphic design intern for The Chicago Lighthouse. </p> 

                <p> When I am not in class or doing work for my design classes, you might find me fundraising and volunteering for Camp Kesem, which provides a weeklong sleepover camp in the summer for kids whose parents are affected by cancer. You can also find me hiking, participating in exercise dance classes and rock-climbing in our student center, and baking old and new concoctions. I also love to travel. I was fortunate to travel to London last summer as part of a study abroad program and will participate in a Jerusalem study abroad program this summer as well as spend my 2019 fall semester in Rome. </p>
