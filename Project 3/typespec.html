                <p>This is a type specimen book that I recently created and designed. This book is 9.5" x 8" with the colored pages being an inch and a half longer than the other pages, making those smaller pages 9.5" x 6.5". When I was first asked to pick a typeface for a type specimen book, I immediately went to the typeface Engravers Old English, as it is the font used for Taylor Swiftâ€™s Reputation album and I am a big fan of hers. However, as I looked more into Engravers Old English, I was unable to find much information about the history of the typeface. It was at that point that I began to learn about Morris Fuller Benton, the creator of Engravers Old English, who designed many typefaces, one of which was Franklin Gothic. Franklin Gothic initially intrigued me because of the boldness of the san serif font and the fact that it is the font that greatly inspired the typeface for MOMA which was the source of inspiration for the colors and style of this book.</p>

                    <p>After many weeks of hard work,  I finished this book and am very proud of the results as it was a the biggest design project that I have done yet. Doing this project made me think about things that I would have never thought of before, like making sure each page is different but consistent enough with each other. Additionally, I learned to really pay attention to detail like kerning and spacing through this whole process. I actually enjoyed the physical crafting of this book as I like to make things with my hands in addition to on my computer. </p>
