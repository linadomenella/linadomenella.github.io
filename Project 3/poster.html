                <p>Presented with only the information for this conference (i.e., the title, the dates, times, presentations etc.), I was tasked to create a poster design that would draw attention to the conference and convey the necessary details. The challenge was to include all the information within the design. I chose this layout because there was a strong sense of hierarchy within it and I believe that the colors help allude to that hierarchy.</p>

                    <p>After some sketches and inspiration from outside sources, I landed on the layout of this poster, which is seen here and in my sketches. From my sketches to this digital mockup I switched some things around to change the hierarchy of this poster and added this color scheme to enhance the design.  I knew that I wanted the background color and the words “Type Grid Convention” to be various shades of each other so that the actual information on the poster would not be overpowered, which is also why I made the information in a brighter color. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>I choose this design as my final design because I thought that this color scheme was more effective than the previous one. Something that I changed from the digital mockup aside from the color scheme was that I made the times a different color in this one and put the speakers job title and place that they worked in italic to show hierarchy. Finally, I added the Notre Dame logo to the bottom left of the page to easier draw the readers eye to the sponsors as they were getting a little lost before.</p>
