            <p>I created these banners which are 14 ft x 4 ft and designed to hang on the side of the fence of The Chicago Lighthouse to advertise the Preschool. I was given last yearâ€™s design for the banner and decided to completely update it to make it more legible. After many iterations and consulting with my boss, I finalized the design.</p>

            <p>Clocks are one of the things that The Chicago Lighthouse prides itself on as all clocks are made by visually impaired people. Therefore, it was no surprised that I was asked to create a clock. I was asked to design a clock for Texas and after researching past clocks created for states by The Chicago Lighthouse, I began to start my designing process. I settled on putting the Texas flag inside the clock and went through many iteration before I arrived on the final design. </p>
