            <p>Teasers are small graphics at the bottom of the front page of the Observer, Notre Dame's school newspaper, that I create to highlight the stories that will appear in the paper. The goal of a teaser is to entice the reader to find the story and thus they must grab the reader’s attention. This is the hardest part about making a teaser because you have to catch the readers eye with such a small space. As the front page is usually not in color, I utilize a strong contrast of black in white to draw the reader’s eye to the teaser. All teasers are the same size, 1.92 x 0.75.</p>

            <p>As a graphic designer for the school newspaper, The Observer, I also create banners. Banners are graphics that span the width of a newspaper page made with the title of the story on it and the full story below it. I research what the story is about and then depending on what I find, I make a graphic that references the story. This can be challenging as the banners are all very long but not very tall so it can be difficult to make graphics work with that size constraint. I believe these banners work as the graphics and layout allude to the story and entice the viewer to learn more.</p>

            <p>As a graphic designer for Notre Dame’s school newspaper, The Observer, I am occasionally tasked with creating full pages for the newspaper. I am given all of the text, including the title, and a photo or two that I need to include but it is my job to put this information in a manner that attracts the reader to pause and read it. All of that information can make this task difficult as sometimes there is so much text that it is hard to fit it all in and also make it look visually appealing. I approach these full page ads by researching what the story is about and then looking for a background design that visually looks good with the information that needs to be conveyed. These full pages work because the viewer has a quick sense of the text at first glance of the page and can then get more details if they are interested.</p>
